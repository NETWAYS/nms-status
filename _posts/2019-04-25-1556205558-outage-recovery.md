| Affected:         |   | All Customers with NFS Storage / Virtual Machines |

| Description:      |   | We have implemented a fix for the interruptions on our Ceph Storage. All systems are operational again. |
| Add. Info:        |   | We had routing issues on one of our ceph servers (ceph11). Partly requests were not served or hung. Until the final problem solution, the server was removed from the cluster. Outage affected 9 placement groups, and systems seeking access to these areas were experiencing these issues. The routing problems has been fixed and the server is back in the cluster. |
