| Description:      |   | We have implemented a fix for the high latencies on our Ceph Storage. All systems are operational again. |
| Add. Info:        |   | Several faulty OSDs have caused a heavy load so that other functional OSDs have been affected, too. The faulty components were deconfigured to recover the Ceph cluster. |
