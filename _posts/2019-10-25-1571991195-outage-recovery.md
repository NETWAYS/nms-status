| Systems:          |   | SOLVED - Issues with Firewall|
| Affected:         |   | All Customers with Managed Hosting / Virtual Machines / Shared Loadbalancers / Shared Firewalls |

| Description:      |   | We have implemented a fix for the DDos-Attack issues on our Firewall. All systems are operational again. |
| Add. Info:        |   | We received a large number of new connections that our firewall could not handle. We blocked the corresponding attacker networks, whereupon a short time later the situation relaxed. During the attack not all requests could be served. All customers were affected by managed firewalls or OpenNebula VMs. The OpenStack environment was not affected by the attack. |
