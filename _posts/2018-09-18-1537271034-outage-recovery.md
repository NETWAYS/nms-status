| Description:      |   | We have implemented a fix for the interruptions on our Network. All systems are operational again. |
| Add. Info:        |   | One of our ISPs did a missconfiguration on a component connected to our central network. Some connections broke due to flapping topology changes. There were two short interruptions with approximately 60 seconds duration. |
