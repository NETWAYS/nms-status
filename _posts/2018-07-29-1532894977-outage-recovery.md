| Description:      |   | We have implemented a fix for the DDos-Attack issues on our Network. All systems are operational again. |
| Add. Info:        |   | The attack started around 9 PM CEST and was launched from a chinese IP. Our firewall was not able to handle the amount of sessions. But we finally managed to block the attacker and the network problems are now resolved.  |
