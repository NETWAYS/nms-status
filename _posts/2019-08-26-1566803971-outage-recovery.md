| Description:      |   | We have implemented a fix for the interruptions on our Firewall. All systems are operational again. |
| Add. Info:        |   | A faulty switch at our upstream provider has prevented our firewall cluster from a successfull failover.
As a consequence, VPN connections were not able to be initiated.
We managed to initiate the failover manually and all connections have been restored. |
